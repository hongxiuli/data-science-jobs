# data-science-jobs
This project is to analyze the most-wanted skills for data scientists and potentially which skills are linked with higher salaries. 

TODOs:
  - Scrape job meta data from indeed
  - Scrape job details for each job
  - Extract skills from job details
  - Scrape job salaries (these may not be available from indeed so may need to scrape data from other sites such as glassdoor
  - Analyze skills VS salaries
  - More analysis to be defined :)
